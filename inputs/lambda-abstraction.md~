### Example: summation of natural numbers

How do we define the function that takes a number $n$ and returns the sum $n+n$?

Sometimes we write $f(n) = n+n$.

Then $f(2) = 2+2 = 4$.

But the expression $n+n$ by itself has no obvious meaning. 

Is $n$ a fixed constant or a variable?

In Lambda Calculus, $n+n$ is not a function. But $f$ is a function!

Test: can you "apply" $n+n$ to anything?
