### Conclusion

+ **Next 50 years:** need to integrate Complexity/Algorithms and
  Programming Language Theory.

+ **Cost models:** should be based on languages, not machines. 
  Particularly important for parallelism.

+ **Other opportunities:** Verification, type-theory and complexity,
  probabilistic programming, programs-as-data, cryptography
  and PL, game-theory and PL.
