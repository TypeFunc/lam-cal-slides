### Church: <a class="highlight-blue">*way*</a> ahead of his time

**Key Idea:**

1. Fix an order that is parallel, and cheap to evaluate.  
2. Base a cost model on it.  
3. Bound cost when mapped to standard models.  

Once we have an order, we can:

+ count number of reductions (work)

+ count number of parallel steps (depth or span)
