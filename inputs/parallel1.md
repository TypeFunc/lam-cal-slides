Turing was ahead of his time...

...but Church was <a class="highlight-blue">*way*</a> ahead of his time.

+ $\lambda$-calculus does not define a reduction order.

+ **Problem:** does not make for a good cost model because 
number of steps depends on the reduction order and 
some orders are not efficient to evaluate.

+ **Virtue:** it is inherently parallel!!
