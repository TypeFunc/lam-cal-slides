### Turing was way ahead of his time

...but Church was way <a class="highlight-blue">*way*</a> ahead of his time.

+ The $\lambda$-calculus does not define reduction order.

+ **Problem:** does not make for a good cost model because 
number of steps depends on the reduction order and 
some orders are not efficient to evaluate.

+ **Virtue:** it is inherently parallel!!
